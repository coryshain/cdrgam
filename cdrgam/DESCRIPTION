Description: A suite of utility functions to support continuous-time
    deconvolutional regression (CDR) of nonlinear impulse response
    functions (IRFs), based on generalized additive models (GAMs) as
    implemented by Simon Woods' mgcv package. Provided functions help
    organize data, define models, visualize estimates, and perform
    statistical model comparison. These functions reduce the likelihood of
    user error and simplify the process of spinning up new CDR-GAM
    analyses from scratch.
