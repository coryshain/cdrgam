Description: An `R` suite of utility functions to support continuous-time
    deconvolutional regression (CDR) of nonlinear impulse response
    functions (IRFs), based on generalized additive models (GAMs) as
    implemented by Simon Woods' `mgcv` package. No modifications are made
    to the model itself, since `mgcv`'s native "linear functional terms"
    feature can be exploited to ensure that a GAM smooth implements a
    continuous-time and potentially nonlinear convolution kernel. In other
    words, a CDR model can be instantiated as a GAM model using
    functionality already available through `mgcv`. However, in practice,
    implementation is non-trivial: in order for a GAM to be a valid CDR
    model, the data must be organized in a particular way and the model
    must have a particular structure.  Moreover, `mgcv`'s standard
    visualization tools are ill-suited to CDR applications. This package
    facilitates the use of `mgcv` for CDR modeling by providing helper
    functions to organize data, define models, visualize estimates, and
    perform statistical model comparison. These functions reduce the
    likelihood of user error and simplify the process of spinning up new
    CDR-GAM analyses from scratch.
